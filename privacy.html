        Like many websites, jarondl.net uses Google Analytics to track
        traffic and learn more about its audience. It is hosted on GitHub Pages,
        and it also uses cloudflare to distribute traffic.

        <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
        We use the standard Google Analytics snippet. You can learn more about
        it and about opt-out options here:

        <h3>Clouflare</h3>
        All traffic to / from this website goes through Cloudflare. They collect
        some info, and add a cookie <code>__cfduid</code>, presumibly to identify
        trusted machines with untrusted IPs. Learn more about it at:
        <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/security-policy/">https://www.cloudflare.com/security-policy/</a>
        and at:

        <h3>GitHub Pages</h3>
        This website is hosted on GitHub pages (which also uses a CDN, fastly).
        They can collect plenty of data. I assume that this is covered by:

        <h3>Everyone else</h3>
        Your ISP and DNS providers will know that you looked for <a href="https://jarondl.net">jarondl.net</a>,
        as will many other intermediate servers. They will not, however, know which specific pages
        you looked at. (Cloudflare, GitHub and Google Analytics will know that, in an annonymized fashion).
        Unfortunately, some servers between Cloudflare and GitHub will also know that, because of:
